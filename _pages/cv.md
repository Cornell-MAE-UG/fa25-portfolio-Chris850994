#### Objective
Second-year Biological Engineering student with hands-on experience in experimental design, data analytics (R), and histological 
techniques, seeking an internship in Quality Control, Analytical Development, or Supply Chain Management at a cell and gene therapy 
CDMO. Independent research on the physiological effects of acoustic stressors on marine organisms involved statistical modeling, assay 
development, and biological systems analysis—reinforcing principles of data integrity, reproducibility, and process control. Field-based 
research with the Pacific Whale Foundation and Hawaii Wildlife Fund provided experience in biomonitoring, sample handling, and 
environmental data management under dynamic conditions. Participated in advanced science programs at Harvard Summer School, UH 
Mānoa, Hurricane Island, and Earthwatch Institute, gaining exposure to molecular biology, bioinstrumentation, and coordinated research 
logistics. Brings a systems-level understanding of biology and a commitment to precision, operational rigor, and cross-functional 
collaboration in support of CGT innovation and manufacturing excellence.
