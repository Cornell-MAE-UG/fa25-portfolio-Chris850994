## About Me


assets/images/thumbnail_IMG_6075.jpg

 
My name is Christopher Ahn, and I am a junior majoring in biological engineering at Cornell University.  I have an interest in aquaculture and hope to use the knowledge and skill I develop at Cornell to innovate with the sphere of aquaculture. With my experience with fieldwork and research within the realm of marinebiology, I hope to bring a new approach to aqaculture and develop the medium.
